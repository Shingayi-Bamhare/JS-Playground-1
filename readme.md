# JS-Playground

It is not a serious project â€” really. It's made just to quickly smash some testing JavaScript environment to play around with some brand new framework (because this one that came out week ago is already outdated).

## How?

```
git clone git@github.com:pawelgrzybek/JS-Playground.git
cd JS-Playground
```
then

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

or :)

```
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
